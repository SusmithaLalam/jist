			"question": "What is a convolutional neural network (or C N N) and where is it used?",
			"lesson": "10",
			"answer": "A convolutional neural network is a special type of artificial neural network that uses perceptrons, a machine learning unit algorithm, for supervised learning, to analyze data. In CNN, the nodes of a layer are connected to multiple nodes of the previous layer and the next layer. CNNs are used in image recognition, natural language processing and several other cognitive tasks."

			"question": "What is Deep learning? Who coined the term deep learning? Can you give an example of where deep learning is used?",
			"lesson": "10",
			"answer": "Deep learning is machine learning using a deep neural network. In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al published a paper on training deep neural networks to recognize hand-written digits with greater than 98% accuracy, and they coined the term deep learning. Deep learning has many applications such as web search ranking, speech recognition, face recognition, autonomous vehicle, etc."

			"lesson": "10",
			"answer": "Data science is a broad field which may include Machine learning, statistics as well as human experts. For example, regression, na√Øve Bayes and supervised clustering techniques use data to learn. Whereas, in unsupervised clustering, the final labeling of the found clusters and the interpretation is often done by human data science experts who also have domain knowledge. "
