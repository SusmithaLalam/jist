			"lesson": "3",
			"answer": "My broad engineering background helps me to look at projects from a wider perspective. Your company is a leader in business solutions. You are already working on integrating your traditional ERP solution with AI and ML-based business analytics. I took a few courses in computer science, did a small project on that during my training and found it very exciting to see how much we can learn from the existing data and make smart decisions. I want to learn more about it and apply it to solve real problems. I think this position will give me the right opportunity to contribute something significant to a futuristic product of your company."

			"lesson": "3",
			"answer": "When I was working on my project (or at my current job, or during my internship), I hit an obstacleâ€”our method just did not work; it produced unreasonable results. We tried many modifications, struggled for months, still the results were far from measured data. My guide and I thought we chose the wrong path and probably should abandon it. I was thinking about it day and night. One Saturday morning about 3 AM, I got an idea to solve that problem. I woke up and worked out the mathematics. I went to my lab and quickly changed our program and ran it, which produced quite reasonable results. I got very excited and refined the code and played with a few input parameters, the results were very satisfactory. On Monday morning, I showed my work to my guide, he was very happy. My project was essentially finished and we will publish our work soon. That was possibly my biggest accomplishment so far. "
