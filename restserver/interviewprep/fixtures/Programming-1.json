			"lesson": "12",
			"answer": "In C C++, a pointer is a variable that contains the address of another variable.  As an example, a pointer that points to a variable x, we can declare    int  *px; Then the pointer can be assigned as px = &x , that is, px holds the address of x. If we want to fetch the actual value of x through this pointer and assign to a variable y, we can write y = *px. "

			"lesson": "12",
			"answer": "In C, there are two ways to fetch the value of an element from an array. We can use the subscript for example x = a[i]. Or we can use a pointer pa = &a[0] or simply pa = a, which points to the zeroth element of the array a. Then to get the value of the i-th element we can write x = *(pa+i)"

			"title": "Function 1",
			"question": "How would you change the value of an argument of a function in C?",
			"lesson": "12",
			"answer": "Since in C the arguments are passed to a function by 'Call by value', we have to pass the pointer px to the argument instead of argument x itself. Then we can change the value of x as *px = z, for example."

		"fields": {
			"title": "Call by Value",
			"question": "What is Call by value and what is Call by reference?",
			"lesson": "12",
			"answer": "In a function call, if we use call by value the actual value of the argument ( or parameter ) is passed, a copy is made within the function, stored at a different location and its change within the function is not reflected in the argument value of the caller function. Whereas, in call by reference, the argument location is passed to the function, so the calling and caller function share the same location of the argument Any change in the argument value made within the function changes the original argument value in the caller function."

When you write the code on the whiteboard, keep talking about what you are doing so that the interviewer understands how you are thinking. You should write a few comments in English to explain the major steps involved.  Feel free to write the pseudo-code or draw a flowchart first, so that your approach, design and the logic are clear )"
