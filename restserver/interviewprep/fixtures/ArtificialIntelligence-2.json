			"title": "under-fitting example",
			"question": "Give an example of under-fitting? .",
			"lesson": "11",
			"answer": "An example of under-fitting would be if the data actually represents a non-linear or polynomial relationship and we try to fit a linear regression model, the prediction could be inaccurate. In fact, trying to fit a straight line to the measured data of the motion of a comet or asteroid, will not be sensible."

			"answer": "In machine learning, over-fitting refers to making the model unnecessarily complex which may obscure the main features and objective. "

			"title": "Regularization",
			"question": "How can you handle the over-fitting in machine learning?",
			"lesson": "11",
			"answer": "Regularization is a technique of introducing additional information or constraints in order to prevent over-fitting. A hyperparameter is a parameter used to control the amount of regularization in certain algorithms and its value is set before the learning process begins."

			"title": "over-fitting Symptoms",
			"question": "Suppose your model performs great on training data but poorly predicts new instances, what could be wrong? Can you name a few possible solutions?",
			"lesson": "11",
			"answer": "This can happen in case of over-fitting for example. We need to use more training data, reduce the number of parameters or features, use a hyperparameter for regularization and tune it. For example, given N measured X and Y data one could fit an N minus 1 order polynomials through them but that may be over-fitting, possibly just a linear model better represents the behavior."

			"title": "Dropout regularization",
			"question": "How does the dropout for regularization work in a Deep Neural Network?",
			"lesson": "11",
			"answer": "If a deep neural network is trained with a few sample data, it may cause over-fitting. Large weights are usually a sign of over-fitting. Probabilistically dropping out a few nodes and its connections in the network together with weight constraints is an effective method of regularization."

We constantly try to improve our efficiency in doing a few things, AI can track our activities and suggest how we can improve. For example, if someone often makes a particular type of math mistakes while doing the homework, it can help him or her by identifying some of the weakest points, their main causes and can suggest how to improve by bringing up the best examples from some of the teachers or students."
