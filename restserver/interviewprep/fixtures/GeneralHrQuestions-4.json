I also think about how to prevent similar failures, make notes, and implement it in the future."

Then a paper was published by a team from the UK which essentially had what I was planning to do. So, instead of changing my project for which we did not have enough time left, I looked at what they had done. I found a more efficient way of doing it and worked long hours for five weeks to implement that in my project. Thus, I could do something new as well as finish my project on time."

If yes, I will do it even if I have to postpone my holidays. If it seems impossible to do in two days, I will ask the manager to give me the support of another team member or negotiate the time with the customer.
