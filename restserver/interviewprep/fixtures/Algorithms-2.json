			"lesson": "5",
			"answer": "A tree traversals can be classified into Breadth First (or level-order traversal) and Depth First Traversal. The Depth First traversal can be of the type preorder, in-order, or post-order traversal depending on the order in which the nodes are visited."

			"answer": "Breadth First Search or BFS is an algorithm for traversing a graph. In BFS, we start with a node and search the nodes layer-wise or breadth-wise and then move to the next level or layer and keep track of which nodes have been visited using, for example, a boolean array."

			"answer": "Monte Carlo tree search or MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of decision processes by random sampling of the search space, expanding the search tree, and analyzing the most promising decisions or moves. MCTS is used in computer games such as Go, chess, bridge, and poker."

			"question": "What is the Bellman Ford algorithm for finding the single source shortest paths?",
			"lesson": "5",
			"answer": "The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the single source shortest paths by repeatedly relaxing distances until there are no more distances to relax. Relaxing distances is done by checking if an intermediate point provides a better path than the currently chosen path. After a number of iterations that is slightly less than the node count, we can check if the solution is optimal. If not, there is a cycle of negative edges that will provide better paths infinitely long."

			"lesson": "5",

			"title": "Boyer Moore",
			"question": "Can you explain the idea behind the Boyer-Moore algorithm in simple words to us?",
			"lesson": "5",
			"answer": "The Boyer-Moore algorithm searches for occurrences of pattern P in text T by performing explicit character comparisons at different alignments. It preprocesses the pattern and the information gained from that is used to skip as many alignments as possible. The main idea is to compare the end of the pattern to the text and thus, in case of a mismatch, avoid unnecessary backward search along the text. If the character of the text does not match any of the characters in the pattern, then the search can be skipped by the length of the pattern. This makes the Boyer-Moore algorithm quite efficient and it is the standard benchmark for string search algorithms. "

These additional links allow fast transitions between failed string matches to other branches of the trie that share a common prefix. This allows the automation to transition between string matches without the need for back-tracking."

			"answer": "Round Robin is a preemptive process scheduling algorithm. Each process is provided a fixed time to execute. Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and the other process executes for a given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes."
