			"lesson": "6",
			"answer": "The purpose of Dijkstra's algorithm is to find the shortest paths between the nodes in a weighted directed graph. Given a source node, Dijkstra's algorithm can find the shortest path to all other nodes producing a shortest-path tree. It is used in network routing protocols, finding the shortest route between one city and all other cities, etc."

			"question": "So suppose, several companies representatives from various cities are to come for a meeting to be held in one of those cities. They all travel by cars. How would you choose a city for the meeting so that the total distance traveled by all the participants is minimum?",
			"lesson": "6",
			"answer": "We can reverse the problem as minimum distance traveled from a city to reach each of the other cities. We can choose one city as the source node and find the shortest paths to all other cities to generate a total distance traveled. Then we can repeat that process for each city as the source node. Finally, we have to select the city that gives the minimum of all these shortest total paths to be traveled. In fact, with some modifications to the algorithm, we can find the best car-pooling suggestions to reduce the fuel cost."

If we directly multiply following the definition of matrix multiplication as we do in hand calculations, that will take time of the order of n to the power 3 for two n by n matrices. So, for large matrices, we can use a more efficient algorithm, for example, Strassen algorithm whose time complexity is n to the power 2.8 or Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm whose time complexity is of the order of n to the power 2.375"

Then the master theorem gives the asymptotic estimate of time in 3 different cases.   Case 1. When the running time is dominated by the cost at the leaves  If f(n) = O (n^logb(a) - epsilon) , then T(n) = Theta (n^logb(a) for epsilon >0        Case 2. When running time is evenly distributed throughout the tree.  If f(n) = Theta (n^ logb(a)), then  T(n) = Theta (n^ logb(a) times log(n))      Case 3. When the running time is dominated by the cost at the root. If f(n) = Omega (n^Logb(a) + epsilon) then T(n) = Theta(f(n)) for epsilon > 0. "
