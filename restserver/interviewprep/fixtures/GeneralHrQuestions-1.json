			"answer": "I'm Anita Roy. I'm from Boston where I did my schooling. Since my childhood, I was very interested in computers. So I chose to study Computer Science and Engineering at the North-Eastern University. I am a good student. I like all subjects but Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are my favorite subjects. I am creative and love to solve challenging technical problems. I hope to work for an innovative company such as yours where I get the opportunity to learn new technologies and implement them to create products for the benefit of the company and society."

I have put in twice the time and effort normally needed to do my undergrad project. My guide is very happy with the work I have done.
